Preparation
===========


Before You Start
================

Before starting the upgrade check your system for compatibility with a newer
TYPO3 version.

*  Enable the deprecation log and let it run for a while while the website is
   used to catch all deprecations

*  Check installed extensions for versions compatible to the target TYPO3
   version

*  Try the upgrade on a development system first or create a parallel instance

*  Run the extension scanner (see below)

Handling Deprecations
=====================

If you notice some API you are using is deprecated, you should look up the
corresponding `ChangeLog <https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/extensions/core/>`_
entry and see how to migrate your code corresponding to the documentation.

Since TYPO3 v9 an extension scanner is included, that provides basic scanning
of your extensions for deprecated code. While it does not catch everything, it
can be used as a base for an upgrade. You can either access the extension
scanner via the TYPO3 admin tools (Backend > Module "Upgrade" > "Scan Extension
Files") or as a standalone tool (https://github.com/tuurlijk/typo3scan)

Read where to find deprecation documentation in the chapter about
:ref:`check-the-changelog-and-news-md`.

.. note::

   TYPO3 aims at providing a reliable backwards compatibility between versions:

   *  Minor versions are always backwards compatible

   *  Major versions may contain breaking changes - normally these are
      deprecated in the version before

   *  Most breaking changes usually happen in the first Sprint Release

   If PHP classes, methods, constants, functions or parameters are to be
   removed, they will be *marked as deprecated* first and not removed until the
   next major release of TYPO3. For example: a method that gets deprecated in
   version 9.4.0 will remain fully functional in all 9.x.x releases, but will
   be removed in version 10.

   This strategy gives developers sufficient time to adjust their TYPO3
   extensions, assuming many agencies upgrade from one LTS release to the next
   (usually 1.5 years).
